# Real-Time Sales & Recommendation System

A real-time sales insights and recommendation system built with Laravel, Node.js (Socket.IO), and SQLite.  
The system provides real-time updates of sales analytics, integrates with AI for recommendations, and uses weather data to adjust promotions.

## Features

### Orders Management

  - Promote **hot drinks on cold days**.

## Project Practices

- **Database**: Pure `Query Builder` (`DB` facade), no Eloquent ORM.
- **WebSocket**: Custom Node.js `socket.js` server.
- **AI integration**: Clean Laravel service to interact with OpenAI API.
- **Weather Integration**: Uses OpenWeather API via Guzzle HTTP client.

## Notes

- **AI Assistance**:
  - AI helped me write and optimize complex **Query Builder queries** because I am primarily experienced with Eloquent ORM and was not confident writing advanced aggregations with Query Builder.
  - AI also supported me in configuring and debugging **Socket.IO server integration with Laravel Broadcasting (Redis + Node.js)**.
  - AI assisted me in integrating **OpenWeather API using Guzzle Client**.
